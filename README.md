Comprehensive and complete set of Python OPPE questions and answers are found in this repository. It contains all question papers for all academic terms of September 2024 and January 2025.  This is for students and educators looking for structurally sound solutions and being well-prepared for exams. All contributions and discussions are welcome!

 Section 1-Problem 1

Sum of squares and absolute difference of squares
Write a function sum_squares_abs_diff_squares that takes two integer inputs, a and b, and returns a tuple with:

    1. The sum of the squares of a and b.

    2. The absolute difference of the squares of a and b.

NOTE: This is a function type question, you don't have to take input or print the output, just have to complete the required function definition.

Example
Given the inputs a = 3 and b = 4:

 Section 1 - Problem 2
 
Is Odd-Length Palindrome
Write a function is_odd_length_palindrome that takes a string s and returns True if s is a palindrome of odd length, and False otherwise.

NOTE: This is a function type question, you don't have to take input or print the output, just have to complete the required function definition.

Example

    • "hello" --> False (not a palindrome)

    • "noon" --> False (palindrome but not odd length)

    • "nun" --> True (palindrome and odd length)

 Section 1 - Problem 3
 
Remove elements at given two indices of a list
Write a function remove_elements_at_two_indices that takes a list l and two indices i1 and i2. The function should remove the elements at these two indices from the list l.

Assume the indices are non-negative and unique.

The function should not return anything but should modify the input list directly.

NOTE: This is a function type question, you don't have to take input or print the output, just have to complete the required function definition.

Example

>>> l = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
>>> i1 = 5
>>> i2 = 1
>>> remove_elements_at_two_indices(l, i1, i2)
>>> l
[1, 3, 4, 5, 7]
